## Balloon Reverse Racer

Build a car at the event **OR** at home with the specified materials that uses a balloon for propulsion. Race your car head-to-head against everyone else (double-elimination format). The **last** car to touch the finish line wins.

## Spirit of the contests

This is an engineering contest not a language contest. The point is to design and build something well, not argue about language and semantics.

 * If you have questions about the rules prior to the event ask Joe
 * Don't look for possible loopholes in the rules
 * Don't try to exploit possible loopholes in the rules
 * **Don't** be **THAT PERSON**

## *That Person* Mitigation Protocol (TPMP)

If at any time during the contest someone is accused of that-person-hood, and the complaint is deemed valid by the EngiGames benevolent dictator, the following protocol will be executed:

All competitors, by gladiator-styled thumbs-up/thumbs-down, will vote as to whether the entry violates the *spirit* of the contest. If a negative verdict is rendered the entry is disqualified and the offender is required to purchase a round of beer for all competitors. So let it be written, so let it be done.

## Car Rules

 1. The car must be built with only the materials specified (they don't have to be identical but must be very similar)
 2. If you build your car at home you'll still need to use an event-supplied balloon on your car for the actual race
 3. Only one balloon may be used in the final design (all other materials can be used as much as desired)
 4. Must be a car (minimum of three wheels)
 5. The car must start entirely behind the starting line
 6. The race is finished when any part of the last car touches the finish line
 7. The balloon must be the source of propulsion
 8. Repairs and modifications can be made between qualifying rounds
 9. You will have one(1) hour to build your car and approximately three(3) minutes between matches

## Event Rules

 1. Build-at-the-event starts at 5pm
 2. Inspections for home-built cars starts at 6:45pm
 3. Brackets will be generated at random and races will start at 7pm
 4. Race track is aproximately 10' in length
 5. The **last** car to touch the finish line is the winner
 6. Your car must touch the finish line within 60 seconds of starting
 7. If one of the cars in a race fails to touch the finish line within 60 seconds the car that did pass the finish line wins that race
 8. If both cars in a race fail to touch the finish line within 60 seconds a second attempt will be allowed
 9. If, on the second attempt, both cars fail to touch the finish line a coin will be flipped to decide the winner

## Tools

You can bring your own multi-tool or similar -- some scissors may be supplied

## Example Car

Don't know where to start? Here's a simple car, built from the listed materials, that can go 6' in a few seconds.
