## Balloon Car Endurance

Build a car at the event **OR** at home with the specified materials that uses a balloon for propulsion. The car that goes the longest distance wins.

## Spirit of the contests

This is an engineering contest not a language contest. The point is to design and build something well, not argue about language and semantics.

 * Don't look for possible loopholes in the rules
 * Don't try to exploit possible loopholes in the rules
 * **Don't** be **THAT PERSON**

## *That Person* Mitigation Protocol (TPMP)

If at any time during the contest someone is accused of that-person-hood, and the complaint is deemed valid by the EngiGames benevolent dictator, the following protocol will be executed:

All competitors, by gladiator-styled thumbs-up/thumbs-down, will vote as to whether the entry violates the *spirit* of the contest. If a negative verdict is rendered the entry is disqualified and the offender is required to purchase a round of beer for all competitors. So let it be written, so let it be done.

## When

TBD

 * Build-at-the-event: 5pm-7pm
 * Contest: 7pm

## Where

TBD

## Materials

 * Masking tape (1/2")
 * 3x5 index cards
 * Plastic straws
 * Wooden skewers (aprox. 1/8" diameter round, 12" long)
 * [Standard Party Balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_balloon#/media/File:InflatableBalloons.jpg)

## Car Rules

 1. The car must be built with only the materials specified
 2. Must be a car (minimum of three wheels)
 3. The car must start entirely behind the starting line
 4. The distance travelled will be measured by the distance from the starting line to the front of your car
 5. Only one balloon may be used in the final design (all other materials can be used as much as desired)
 6. The balloon must be the source of propulsion (air from the balloon must push the car)
 7. Repairs and modifications can be made between qualifying rounds

## Event Rules

If you're going to build at the event show up at 5pm. At 6:45pm inspections for all cars will begin. You may build the car with materials from home that are similar to event materials but **your car must use an event-supplied balloon for propulsion**. The contest begins at 7pm.

### Round 1

Everyone goes.

### Round 2

The top three (3) from round one have five minutes to make any changes to their car and will go again.

## Round 3

The top two from round two have five minutes to make any changes and go again. This determines the winner.

## Tools

You can bring your own multi-tool or similar -- some scissors may be supplied

## Example Car

Don't know where to start? Here's a simple car, built from the listed materials, which can go ~15 feet.
