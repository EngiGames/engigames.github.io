## Rubber Band Racer

Build a car at the event **OR** at home with the specified materials that uses a rubber band for propulsion. Race your car head-to-head against everyone else (double-elimination format). The track will be a **20 ft** straight-away on a smooth concrete or cement floor.

## Spirit of the contests

This is an engineering contest not a language contest. Writing pages of airtight rules is boring and a waste of time. So...

 * Don't look for possible loopholes in the rules
 * Don't try to exploit possible loopholes in the rules
 * **Don't** be **THAT PERSON**

## *That Person* Mitigation Protocol (TPMP)

If at any time during the contest someone is accused of that-person-hood, and the complaint is deemed valid by the EngiGames benevolent dictator, the following protocol will be executed:

All competitors, by gladiator-styled thumbs-up/thumbs-down, will vote as to whether the entry violates the *spirit* of the contest. If a negative verdict is rendered the entry is disqualified and the offender is required to purchase a round of beer for all competitors. So let it be written, so let it be done.

## When

### Rules for the car:

 1. The car must be built entirely of the materials specified
 3. Must be a car (you know what a car is)
 4. The car must start entirely behind the starting line
 5. The race is won by the first car to touch the finish line
 6. Only one **unmodified** rubber band may be used on your car
 8. The sole source of propulsion must be your rubber band turning the wheels of your car in some manner
 8. Repairs and modifications may be made between races
 9. You may build your car at home and bring it
 10. You may build the car at the event with provided materials (show up at 5pm and you have two hours)
 11. During the race your car must use an event-provided rubber band
 12. All cars are subject to inspection before the race to ensure rule compliance

\* If you'd like to purchase rubber bands that match what will be provided at the event you can get them on [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Alliance-Advantage-Rubber-Band-Inches/dp/B008X09WWQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1463161552&sr=8-1&keywords=advantage+rubber+band+32) or at walmart.

### Rules for the race:

 1. At 6:45pm inspections for all cars will be performed
 2. After inspections race-approved rubber bands will be issued (you can replace the rubber band between each race but it must be event-provided)
 3. There will be no more than 3-minutes between each race
 4. Double-elimination format

## Tools

You may bring tools -- some scissors will be supplied.

## Example Car

Don't know where to start? Here's a simple car, built from the listed materials, that can go 6' in a few seconds.
