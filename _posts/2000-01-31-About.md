EngiGames is a series of contests for engineers local to the Sacramento region.

### The purpose of EngiGames:

 - **Get together** and **have a good time**
 - **Build** stuff and **compete**
 - **Hands-on** projects that **are not a big time commitment**

### Spirit of the contests

These are engineering, not language, contests. Don't try to exploit some loophole in the wording of the rules -- don't be *that person*.

### Format

 - Contest announced ~1 month in advance
 - You are encouraged to invite other engineers you **know personally** to compete
 - Friends and family are encouraged to come spectate, engineers are encouraged to participate
 - Register online before the contest starts (to assist in choosing venue)

### Events

High school physics type events that are simple but challenging. Contests you *could* do on your kitchen table with balsa-wood, glue, and basic hand tools.
