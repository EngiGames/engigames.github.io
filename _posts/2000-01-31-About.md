EngiGames is a series of contests for engineers local to the Sacramento region.

### The purpose of EngiGames:

 - Bring engineers **together**
 - **Build** stuff and **compete**
 - **Hands-on** projects that **are not a big time commitment**

### Spirit of the contests

These are engineering, not language, contests. Don't try to exploit some loophole in the wording of the rules -- don't be *that person*.

### Format

 - Contest announced ~1 month in advance
 - You are encouraged to invite other engineers you **know personally** to compete
 - Friends and family are encouraged spectate, engineers are encouraged to participate
 - Register online before the contest starts (to assist in choosing venue)

### Events

High-school physics type events that:
 - Are simple but challenging
 - Do not give specific types of engineers too much of an advantage
 - Can be as competitive or casual as you like
 - Could be manufactured on your kitchen table with wood and glue or in a high-end CNC shop
