You may want to purchase some [super-glue accelerator](https://www.amazon.com/Bob-Smith-Industries-BSI-151H-Accelerator/dp/B0166FFCCS) if you're going to build your tower the night before.

## Tower Rules

 1. The tower must be built with only Diamond-brand matches and krazy glue
 2. No more than 32 matches may be used in construction
 3. The matches cannot be laminated in glue (if glue drips down a few matches it's fine, but don't coat every match completely in glue)
 4. Matches can be cut
 5. The tower must stand on its own (not glued to the table)
 6. The tower must stand at least 9" tall
 7. You must be able to stack US quarter dollar coins on top of the tower (above 9")

## Event Rules

 1. Tower check-in will start at 6pm
 2. At 7pm competitors will be chosen at random to excercise their tower
 3. You will have five (5) minutes to stack as many quarter dollars on top of your tower
 4. Quarters must be stacked one at a time
 5. Your score will be the number of quarters stacked on your tower when it topples over OR the number of quarters on top of your tower after five (5) minutes
