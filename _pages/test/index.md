EngiGames is a series of contests for engineers local to the Sacramento region.

### The purpose of EngiGames:

 - Bring engineers **together**
 - **Build** stuff and **compete**
 - **Hands-on** projects that **are not a big time commitment**

## Spirit of the contests

This is an engineering contest not a language contest. Writing pages of airtight rules is boring and a waste of time. So...

 * If you have questions about the rules prior to the event ask Joe
 * Don't look for possible loopholes in the rules
 * Don't try to exploit possible loopholes in the rules
 * **Don't** be **THAT PERSON**

## *That Person* Mitigation Protocol (TPMP)

If at any time during the contest someone is accused of that-person-hood, and the complaint is deemed valid by the EngiGames Benevolent Dictator (EGBD), the following protocol will be followed:

All competitors, by gladiator-styled thumbs-up/thumbs-down, will vote as to whether the entry violates the *spirit* of the contest.

If a negative verdict is rendered the entry is disqualified and the offender is required to purchase a round of beer for all competitors. So let it be written, so let it be done.

### Format

 - Contest announced ~1 month in advance
 - You are encouraged to invite other engineers you **know personally** to compete
 - Friends and family are encouraged spectate, engineers are encouraged to participate
 - Register online before the contest starts (to assist in choosing venue)

### The Prize

Winning an EngiGames event is considered, by most, the highest honor in an engineering career -- similar to a noble prize or a participation ribbon from a middle school track meet. But in addition to the bragging rights the winner will have the rare honor of *briefly* wearing the coveted EngiGames **鉢巻** (hachimaki):

At each event the previous winner passes the **鉢巻** to the new winner in a ceremony we call...**The Passing of the 鉢巻**. By winning the EngiGames **鉢巻** you agree to return to the next EngiGames to perform...**The Passing of the 鉢巻**.

### Events

High-school physics type events that:

 - Are simple but challenging
 - Do not give specific types of engineers too much of an advantage
 - Can be as competitive or casual as you like
 - Could be manufactured on your kitchen table with wood and glue or in a high-end CNC shop
